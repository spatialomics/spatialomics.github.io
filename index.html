          <h3 id="project-focus" class="mb-3 mt-4">Project Focus</h3>

          <p>
            The Tubular SOFC Project is dedicated to advancing the field of energy storage and sustainable technology through the development and implementation of tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Solid oxide fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert the chemical energy stored in a fuel, such as hydrogen or natural gas, into electrical energy. These fuel cells offer numerous advantages, including high efficiency, low emissions, and the ability to utilize a wide range of fuels. The project aims to push the boundaries of tubular SOFC technology by focusing on key areas of research and innovation.
          </p>
            The main targets of the T-SOFC Project include:
            <ul class="mt-2">
            <li>Optimizing the design and performance of tubular SOFCs to enhance their efficiency, power density, and durability.</li>
            <li>Exploring novel materials and manufacturing techniques to improve the cost-effectiveness and scalability of tubular SOFC production.</li>
            <li>Investigating advanced fuel cell configurations and system integration approaches for seamless incorporation into existing energy infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with industry partners to identify real-world applications and commercialization opportunities for tubular SOFCs.</li>
            <li>Promoting knowledge dissemination and fostering collaboration among researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts through workshops, seminars, and conferences.</li>
            <li>Addressing challenges related to fuel cell manufacturing, stack assembly, and long-term performance to enhance the reliability and viability of tubular SOFCs.</li>
            <li>Exploring the potential of tubular SOFCs for decentralized energy generation, off-grid applications, and electrification of remote areas.</li>
            <li>By focusing on these targets, the T-SOFC Project aims to accelerate the development and adoption of clean energy technologies, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="c-e" class="mb-3 mt-4">Community engagement</h3>
            <p>
              The T-SOFC Project places great emphasis on community engagement to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. Regular workshops, seminars, and conferences will be organized to provide a platform for researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas and present their work. These events will feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, and interactive sessions, creating opportunities for networking and collaboration. The project also plans to establish an online community forum and open-access publication platform to facilitate ongoing discussions, dissemination of research findings, and collaboration beyond the physical events. By actively engaging the community, the T-SOFC Project aims to create a vibrant ecosystem of stakeholders working together towards a sustainable future.
